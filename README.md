# Flysync - The Android PC Suite

So in our project we tried to make the perfect android pc suite called
Flysync which will provide offline facility. Our Pc suite will also provide cross
platform desktop app. With the use of Flysync we can transfer data as well as we
can manage data from desktop. We can also take backup of our files. We can
manage messages as well as application with the use of Flysync. We will provide
one unique feature i.e. known as selective synchronization. By that user can select
which data he/she want to synchronize with computer or laptop. So security will also
be providing by Flysync.
